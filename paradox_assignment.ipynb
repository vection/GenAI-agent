    "# Paradox Home Assignment\n",
    "Aviv Harazi\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment splits to two parts:\n",
    "1. Generation of fictional GenAI Summer Camp \n",
    "2. Building LLM Assistant Agent \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generation of fictional GenAI Summer Camp \n",
    "First, I made a template for the program and what it should have.\n",
    "This template has a few keys: campName, description, offerings, values, policies, location, dates, pricing, contact, highlights, conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I had the template, the process of creating content happens in four steps. Each step works on certain parts from the template to get more words.\n",
    "All these four steps run together and then come together at the end.\n",
    "The final result is in the form of a dictionary, which is easier to work with.\n",
    "I also designed an enhancement function with the aim of generating more words and enriching the text.\n",
    "The final output is dictionary filled with correct information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building LLM Assistant Agent \n",
    "I employed Langchain to establish an Agent that utilizes custom tools, granting us the capability to carry out actions. The Agent determines which tool to employ based on the input and tool descriptions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed a few tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Register Application Tool: When a parent expresses interest in registering, this tool activates the registration process. It collects parent names, phone numbers, emails, and child ages, and validates the age against camp details. Each application is saved in dictionary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer Pricing or Age-Related Questions: For questions related to pricing or age, the Agent employs a GPT model with pertinent pricing and age information derived from camp details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer Policies and Location Questions: In response to queries regarding policies, location or dates, the Agent employs a GPT model with relevant details from camp information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer General Questions: If queries are general or require more information, the Agent employs a GPT model using pertinent information from camp details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finish Process: If there are no further actions required, the process is concluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run? \n",
    "* Open the notebook via jupyter notebook / google collab\n",
    "* Install the required libraries \n",
    "* Set the API key in openai.api_key parameter \n",
    "* use agent.run() examples to add and check more scenarios."
